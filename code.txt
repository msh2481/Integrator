# A thermostat simulation with time-lagged measurements

T0: 0.0
T1: 30.0
DT: 0.1
METHOD: Heun

INIT:
T_out: -5
T_cur: 10
T_cur[0.5]: 10                                              # the value is not important, T_cur will be used
T_goal: 18

DIFF:
T_out: (sin(t)*10 - T_out) * 10.0                           # hacky way to control variable instead of its derivative
T_cur: (T_goal - T_cur[0.5]) * 0.5\                         # first feedback loop: thermostat pushes T_cur to T_goal, and T_cur is measured with 0.5 sec lag
     + (T_out - T_cur) * 0.1                                # second feedback loop: heat leackage pushes T_cur to T_out
T_goal: 0                                                   # hacky way to have named constants
